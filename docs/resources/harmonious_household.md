# Harmonious Household: Strategies for Shared Chores and Roommate Equity

**Project Context:**
This project, "Trashy Tracker," was initiated to solve a common household issue: ensuring fair and transparent responsibility for taking out the trash among four roommates (KM, NP, PS, LS). The goal is to eliminate disputes and the need for a "chore enforcer."

## Core Philosophy
The system relies on **Visual Accountability** and **Fixed Rotations** to reduce decision fatigue and mental overload.
*   **No "Chore Enforcer":** The system itself dictates responsibility, removing personal conflict.
*   **Low-Tech & Transparent:** Physical, visible trackers are preferred over apps that can be ignored.
*   **Reduce Mental Load:** Roommates don't need to remember "whose turn is it?"—the tracker tells them.

## Key Strategies

### 1. The "Name-Sleeve" Queue System
*   **Concept:** A physical chart with name tag sleeves representing a queue.
*   **Mechanism:** The person at the front of the queue is responsible for the current task.
*   **Action:** Once the chore is completed, the responsible person moves their tag to the back of the queue.
*   **Benefit:** Creates subtle, non-verbal social pressure and clear expectations.

### 2. The "Physical Odometer" Analogy
*   **Concept:** Treat household chores like mileage on a car.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **"Driver":** Folding tabs (like "Now Serving" numbers) indicate who is currently "driving" the chore.
    *   **"Trip History":** A tally table or log records the history of contributions (the "mileage").
*   **Application in Trashy Tracker:** Our generated Excel sheet acts as this odometer, with empty brackets `[ ]` representing the miles to be driven.

## Operational Implementation
To ensure success, the household aligns on:
1.  **Standards:** Defining exactly what "emptying the trash" means (e.g., replace liner, wipe lid, take to curb).
2.  **Master List:** Categorizing chores (Daily vs. Weekly).
3.  **Accountability Agreement:** Pre-deciding how to handle missed chores to avoid in-the-moment conflict.
4.  **Gratitude:** Emphasizing thanks to maintain a positive home environment.
